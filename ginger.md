#Ginger Snap Cookie Recipe(because it's a snap)...duh

##Ingredients

* You will need ginger, duh
* Butter, like the world needs butter, ok
* Milk, if you have a cow on hand that would be cool, mooooo
* You will need eggs, move to England because they use non-refrigerated eggs,and then you wouldn't need a fridge. 
######because in England that's what they do. P.S. I am not an anglophile, more like a francophile... and definitely a technophile.  
* Um... like... you will need sugar... for reals, because if not your cookies will suck
* flour, and that's the other spelling of flower. We don't want you to put roses in the mixing bowl those go to your wife.
* you will need an oven ok, because, you can't cook cookies with your hands unless you're really hot like your wife, the one you're supposed to give flowers too.


#Cooking Directions for Ginger Snaps, because it's a snap, yo.

1. So, like start sentences first with prepositions because it makes you look really smart, and be sure to use a lot of [difluencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency) There is a link if you don't know what that word means. 
2. Very important, be sure to take your a.d.d meds so you can concentrate on these very simple instructions
3. oh yeah.. the cooking part, so um like put all the ingredients in a bowl, no need for measuring, because measuring is for the weak and feeble, just like the left leg, because it's not the dominant right leg, get it, yo?
4. Oh now, put it in the oven at 4:20 because you know why... then pull that shit out: Then take a picture with your cracked iphone, but be sure to use a nashville instagram filter to make it like your cookies are from 1972 when the world was awesome, then post that shit, then cry because no liked your post because your cookies are stale, because they are from 1972.

#Voila!
###Your completed cookies should look like this(complete with tin can)
